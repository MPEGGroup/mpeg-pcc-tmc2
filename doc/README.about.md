General Information
===================

Reference software is being made available to provide a reference
implementation of the V3C standard being developed by MPEG (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 7).  One of the main goals of the reference software is to provide a
basis upon which to conduct experiments in order to determine which coding
tools provide desired coding performance. It is not meant to be a
particularly efficient implementation of anything, and one may notice its
apparent unsuitability for a particular use. It should not be construed to
be a reflection of how complex a production-quality implementation of a
future V3C standard would be.

This document aims to provide guidance on the usage of the reference
software. It is widely suspected to be incomplete and suggestions for
improvements are welcome. Such suggestions and general inquiries may be
sent to the general MPEG 3DGC email reflector at
<mpeg-3dgc@gti.ssr.upm.es> (registration required).
